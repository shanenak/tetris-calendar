# Tetris Calendar

This website was built for the prompt described [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Basil-Front-End-Engineer-Interview-Question-o57ODZrRicGSpizdYsU3z).

## Task

Input: a month and a day (e.g. November 20)
Output: visually generate all possible solutions for that date. A “solution” is a tiling of all the pieces such that only the given day is uncovered.

## Implementation

This quick implementation was built with React.js, Redux, and JavaScript. Efficiency was the main constraint and was not fully optimized within the short time frame. Currently, most dates do not result in a true solution to the problem as they are missing oen or two of the tetris pieces. Further study will be done to increase performance and effectiveness and reduce latency.
